\n To those at Insight, I am very pleased with these analyses as I used a variety of techniques to get answers to questions and also showed a lot of creativity. For example, I had to construct a covariance matrix for dependent variables (virtually unheard of in the literature). I was using Shiny apps as well.
Most importantly, I think we went beyond p-values to think much more carefully about effect sizes. In a way, this was close to the overfitting problem in data science.
The paper was published in one of the top three journals in my field (Psychological Bulletin).
