I am very pleased with these analyses, the high point of which was constructing a covariance matrix for studies with multiple dependent variables (virtually unheard of in the literature).
<br/>Most importantly, I think we went beyond p-values to think much more carefully about effect sizes and their practical implications.
<br/>The paper was published in one of the top three journals in my field (Psychological Bulletin) but that is less important than the gains I made in my analytic techniques.
