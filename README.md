To those at Insight, I am very pleased with these analyses as I used a variety of techniques to get answers to questions and also showed a lot of creativity. For example, I had to construct a covariance matrix for dependent variables (virtually unheard of in the literature). I was using Shiny apps as well.
<br/>Most importantly, I think we went beyond p-values to think much more carefully about effect sizes and their practical implications. In this way, I addressed to key questions in data science: overfitting and practical answers.
<br/>The paper was published in one of the top three journals in my field (Psychological Bulletin) but that is less important than the gains I made in my analytic techniques.
